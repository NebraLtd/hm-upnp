# hm-upnp
UPNP Container for Nebra Hotspots

## Pre built containers

This repo automatically builds docker containers and uploads them to two repositories for easy access:
- [hm-upnp on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nebraltd/hm-upnp)
- [hm-upnp on GitHub Packages](https://github.com/NebraLtd/hm-upnp/pkgs/container/hm-upnp)

The images are tagged using the docker long and short commit SHAs for that release. The current version deployed to miners can be found in the [helium-miner-software repo](https://github.com/NebraLtd/helium-miner-software/blob/production/docker-compose.yml).
